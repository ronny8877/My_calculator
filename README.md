# My_calculator

### It was a lot of typing. But i did it.

Based on My first calculator By  [AceLewis](https://github.com/AceLewis/my_first_calculator.py).

Saw a intagram post a while back, where someone had made a calculator by hardcoding everysingle output. It was a unique, and a fun idea and today i thought about recreating it.

The max ouput it can genrate right now is somewhere between 20 - 21 Million lines..... by setting max_n to 1024.. i tried 1200 ,1150 but it  caused node to crash.
The reason is cause i am using an array to hold the data ** not at all an ideal solution ** and i think it is reaching its upperlimits when going over 1100.
My poor vs code is struggling to open the c file .. so i can't add any screengrabs here. The file size grew over 411 mb and i don't think gcc will complie it.. even if it dose
i am really not in mood to find out how long it'll take.. XD






The code is far from ideal but gets the job done.
